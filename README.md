# Introduction

A `Koa` implementation in Go Language. Inspired by its middleware mechanism, I designed overall framework purely by Go.


# Environment
OS: Win11 x64
Go: 1.21+

# Build Example

I'm lazy, how to use please see the sample code.

Take `example/serve` for example:
```shell
go build -o build/serve.exe github.com/clouddea/koa-go/example/serve
./build/serve --help
./build/serve
```
